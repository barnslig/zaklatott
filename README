== Description ==
Zaklatott is an easy implementation of a decentralised groupchat where all clients have the same right.
If one goes, the others stay in. There is no centralised server who can be crashing.

== Usage Instructions ==
• You need a working Python < 3 and a wxWidgets for Python. (wxPython)
• You need to forward the Port 4220 to your PC and open connections from outside to this port
• Than start the guiclient.py, type in the name of the channel you wanna join
• If you want to join a conversation, you have to type in the IP of one other chatter in the room
 - If not, leave the IP field free, push enter and tell some of the others your ip. The IP of every
   member of the room can be used to join the room.
• Now its time to chat
